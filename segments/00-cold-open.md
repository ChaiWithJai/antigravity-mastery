## The Hook

No slides. No introduction. Just this:

```
Agent Manager > New Conversation

"Build me a todo app with React. Include:
- Add/remove tasks
- Mark complete
- Filter by status
- Local storage persistence

When done, open it in the browser and show me it works."
```

Watch the agent:
1. Create task list
2. Generate implementation plan
3. Write code across multiple files
4. Run the dev server
5. Open browser
6. Take screenshots proving it works

**This is Antigravity.**

## What Just Happened

In traditional AI coding:
- You prompt
- AI suggests code
- You copy/paste
- You run
- You debug
- You verify

In Antigravity:
- You describe the outcome
- Agent plans, implements, runs, verifies
- You review artifacts

**The agent did the loop. You did the review.**

## The Artifacts

Notice what the agent produced:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Task List | What it planned to do |
| Implementation Plan | How it planned to do it |
| Code Diffs | What it actually wrote |
| Terminal Output | What happened when it ran |
| Screenshots | Proof it works |

**Artifacts are trust.**

Without them, you're hoping. With them, you're verifying.

## The Two Views

### Editor View (Cmd + E to toggle)
- Traditional IDE experience
- File explorer, syntax highlighting
- Agent panel on the side
- For synchronous, hands-on work

### Agent Manager (Cmd + E to toggle)
- Mission control for agents
- Spawn multiple agents
- Watch parallel work
- For asynchronous orchestration

**This course teaches you to live in both.**

## The Mindset Shift

**Old mental model:**
> "AI helps me code faster"

**New mental model:**
> "I orchestrate agents that code, run, and verify"

You're not a coder with an AI assistant.
You're a manager with an AI team.
