# Antigravity Mastery

**From copilot to mission control.** Master Google's agentic development platform.

## The Transformation

```
TRADITIONAL AI CODING                  ANTIGRAVITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Inline autocomplete              →   Autonomous agents with artifacts
Chat sidebar for questions       →   Agent Manager orchestrating work
You execute every command        →   Agents execute, you verify
One task at a time               →   Multiple agents, parallel work
Hope it worked                   →   Screenshots, recordings, proofs
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**This is the shift from synchronous coding to asynchronous orchestration.**

---

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you will have:

1. **GEMINI.md** - Global rules that shape all agent behavior
2. **Workspace rules** - Project-specific agent instructions
3. **Custom workflows** - Reusable prompts triggered with `/`
4. **Agent orchestration patterns** - Managing multiple agents
5. **Browser automation setup** - Agents that verify their own work

## Course Structure (3 hours)

| # | Segment | Duration | What Gets Built |
|---|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 0 | Cold Open | 5 min | Live demo: Agent builds app from prompt |
| 1 | Architecture Shift | 20 min | GEMINI.md global rules |
| 2 | Your First Workflow | 35 min | Custom workflow with `/trigger` |
| 3 | Agent Manager | 30 min | Multi-agent orchestration |
| 4 | Browser Automation | 25 min | Chrome extension + verification |
| - | **Break** | 10 min | Catch-up point |
| 5 | Artifacts & Trust | 20 min | Reading and requesting artifacts |
| 6 | Terminal Policies | 15 min | Allow/deny lists, autonomy levels |
| 7 | Knowledge Base | 20 min | Teaching agents your patterns |
| 8 | Production Setup | 15 min | Complete configuration verified |
| 9 | Team Patterns | 25 min | Shared rules and workflows |

**Total: ~3 hours** (180 min + 10 min break)

## Who This Is For

**Ideal Learner:**
- Uses Cursor, Copilot, or Claude Code
- Wants to delegate more, verify less
- Interested in parallel agent workflows
- Comfortable with VS Code-based editors

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic programming experience
- Familiarity with terminal/command line
- Google account (for sign-in)

## The Mental Model Shift

### Before: Synchronous Coding

```
You → Write code → Run → Debug → Repeat
      ↳ AI helps with autocomplete and chat
```

### After: Asynchronous Orchestration

```
You → Describe task → Agent plans → Agent executes → Agent verifies
                                                          ↓
                                           Artifacts: screenshots, recordings, diffs
                                                          ↓
                                                   You review and approve
```

**Key insight**: You're not coding faster. You're coding at a higher level of abstraction.

| 2 | 55m | Build a workflow for your common task | 5 min |
| 3 | 85m | Spawn 2 agents on related tasks | 5 min |
| 4 | 110m | Configure browser automation | 5 min |
| 5 | 150m | Create knowledge base entry | 3 min |

**Total practice time: 21 minutes**

## What Makes Antigravity Different

| Aspect | Traditional AI Coding | Antigravity |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Execution** | You run commands | Agents run commands |
| **Verification** | You check output | Agents produce screenshots |
| **Parallelism** | One conversation | Multiple agents, multiple workspaces |
| **Memory** | Session-based | Knowledge base persists |
| **Trust** | Black box | Artifacts make work visible |
