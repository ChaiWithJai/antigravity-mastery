### Announcement Post (Choose One)

**Template A: Transformation Story**

```
Just completed Antigravity Mastery.

Before:
• One task at a time
• Manual verification
• Starting fresh each session

After:
• Multiple agents working in parallel
• Artifacts that prove work is done
• Knowledge that compounds

The shift from "AI assistant" to "AI team I manage" is real.

Key insight: You're not coding faster—you're coding at a higher level of abstraction.

Thanks @JaiBhagat for the course.

```

**Template B: Specific Win**

```
Built my first multi-agent workflow today.

Two agents working in parallel:
- One building the API
- One building the UI

Coordinated by me in the middle.

Result: 2x the work in the same time, with screenshots proving it all works.

Learned this in Antigravity Mastery by @JaiBhagat.

**Template C: Team Leader Angle**

```
Evaluating Antigravity for my team of [X] engineers.

What stood out:
• Shared rules = team standards enforced by AI
• Shared workflows = repeatable processes
• Artifacts = trust without micromanagement
• Knowledge base = institutional memory

This isn't about faster typing.
It's about scaling expertise.

Antigravity Mastery gave me the playbook.

Thank you for learning with me.

The goal wasn't just to teach Antigravity.
It was to show you how to orchestrate instead of execute.

You manage agents now.
That's the shift.
